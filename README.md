PYTHON TIPS <br>

  - Predefined data structure is very critical for such as tuples, lists, strings, dictionaries. <br>
  - Tuples are useful if you are accessing an array of information. <br>
  - Both lists and strings are helpful. But, I have a tendency to use both integer and char. <br>
  - When you know the size of the array information. A dictionary helps a lot. <br>
  - Creating a hashtable is O(N) time, I learned this from experience. <br>
  - Array can be thought through like this: c[row-1][col-1] <br>
  - Take a class and Practice, Practice, Practice. <br>
  -... <br>

BASH TIPS <br>

  {1..100} is a sequential array of values, I learned the hard way by accessing the wrong integer value. <br>
  Always write a function for bash it helps to create habits for other languages. <br>
  - fun1 { $1} { <br>
  - do  <br>
  - echo "hello" <br>
  - done <br>
  - } <br>
  - ... <br>
